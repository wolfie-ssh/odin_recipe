  <h2>Description</h2>

  <p>A pancake (or hotcake, griddlecake, or flapjack) is a flat cake, often thin and round, prepared from a starch-based batter that may 
    contain eggs, milk and butter, and then cooked on a hot surface such as a griddle or frying pan. It is a type of batter bread.</p>

  <h3>When to flip pancakes</h3>
  <p>Your pancake will tell you when it's ready to flip. Wait until bubbles start to form on the top and the edges look dry and set. This will usually take about two to three minutes on each side.</p>
 
  <h3>How to Reheat Pancakes</h3>
  <p>Don't let leftover pancake batter go to waste! Store the batter in an airtight container in the fridge for up to two days. If you plan to keep it longer than that, it's best to freeze the batter. </p>

  <h3>Can you Freeze Pancakes?</h3>
  <p>Yes, you can freeze pancakes and pancake batter</p>
  <ul>
    <li>To freeze cooked pancakes</li>
    <p>To freeze cooked pancakes: Allow the pancakes to cool completely, then arrange them in a single layer on a baking sheet (make sure the edges aren't touching). Flash freeze for a few hours or up to overnight. Reheat in an oven set to 350 degrees F until warmed through.</p>
    <li>To freeze pancake batter</li>
    <p>Ladle the pancake batter in serving size portions into freezer bags, then wrap the bags in foil. Freeze flat for up to one month. Thaw in the refrigerator overnight. </p>
